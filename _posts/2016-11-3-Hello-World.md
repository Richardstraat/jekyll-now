---

For a sales representative, teaming with his SDR, can be sometimes challenging. Depending who you are as a sales person, you will either succeed or failed in making this relationship work.
I wanted to spend some time in giving more details around some key areas which I have witnessed being the key of a succesfull relationship.


--- #Communication

To build a trustworthy relationship, you first need to understand what you should expect from one another.
You should also understand what motivates and drives your interlocutor.

The first exercise is therefore to clearly stated what are your expectations:

Example:

As a R|ep I expect the SDR | As a SDR I expect the Rep |
to allocate 3 days on outbound prospecting on my territory | to share all his knowledge on the account mapping and and territory mapping |




##Knowledge transfer


##Accountability and transparency


##Mentorship
