For a sales representative, teaming with his SDR, can be sometimes challenging. Depending who you are as a sales person, you will either succeed or failed in making this relationship work.
I wanted to spend some time in giving more details around some key areas which I have witnessed being the key of a succesfull relationship.


# Communication


Whenever, you try to build a partnership, you should first understand what motivates and drives your interlocutor.
An SDR will likely be paid on Sales Accepted lead (SAL) as it is under his control to find and qualify a lead. Upon certain criteria (BANT or (derived version)[http://www.saleshacker.com/bant-sales-qualification-new-era/]) and the validation of the rep accepting the lead as being an opportunity, the SAL will be paid. 



To build a trustworthy relationship, you first need to understand what you should expect from one another.


The first exercise is therefore to clearly stated what are your expectations:

Example:

As a Rep I expect the SDR | As an SDR I expect the Rep |
----|------|
to allocate 3 days on outbound prospecting on my territory | to share all his knowledge on the account (contacts, previous history, possible challenges based on the industry...) |
to share all his weekly activities on the account provided | to develop jointly strategies around the account before contact
to set up a goal of minimum 1 qualified lead a week on my territory | to provide me with a minimum of 5 new accounts every 2 weeks |
to have a well defined agenda on meeting set | accept my lead within 24 hours if qualification criteria met|
