With more than 10 years in experience selling software, I am passionate about technology and how software is changing our lives and transform the enterprise. I have the privilege to work at GitHub where everyday I experience how coding can actually be fun and how companies could embrace frictionless software development workflow to ship reliable piece of software faster than ever and focus on innovation.

### More Information

I am a proud dad of 2 daughter of 8 and 10 years old who can talk english, dutch, french and spanish and who wants their next langage to be HTML and CSS. They even got a test of Python in the last coding dojo.
