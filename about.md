With more than 10 years in experience selling software, I am passionate about technology and how software is changing our lives and transform the enterprise. I have the privilege to work at GitHub where everyday I experience how coding can actually be fun and how companies could embrace frictionless software development workflow to ship reliable piece of software faster than ever which give them confidence in focusing on innovation.
